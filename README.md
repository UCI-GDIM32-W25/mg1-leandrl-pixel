## Q2
- The plan I wrote in MG1 break down activity connects to the code, I planned out the game by seperaring it 
into object, attributes, and actions and this plan helped me in how I wrote
my unity code. The player GameObject represents the control of of the character in simple terms the remote.
The player uses the class to manage its behavior. The bunny sprite is handled through the spriterender
this does not need any code while the number of seeds does and is stored as a member variable for example the 
_numseeds, _numseedsLeft, and _numSeedsPlanted. The update method and player moves are handled in there. 
- seed being planted uses the instaitate(_plantPrefab, Transform.posisiton, quaterion identity). The UI is controlled by 
a different script being the PLantCountUI that updates when the seeds are left and planted using updateseeds whenever the player plants in space bar
